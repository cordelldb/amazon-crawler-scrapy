I think I'm going to just make all my repositories going forward private.  I mean Im not doing anything of consequence, and I rely heavily on tutorials and tons of trial and error to make these little projects work.  But it's still fun for me, I just dont want people thinking, that Im thinking, that I've done something clever or original.  That is clearly not the case so I'll just digitallly obfuscate until i feel worthy.
